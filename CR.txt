0. Do you really need those arrays?
1. no code needs to be commented out - code is either in or deleted. If there is a good reason for code that is commented out, you need to write the reason as a comment.
2. is 0 a valid button? what happens when you try to init joystick button 0? check that.
3. Was this like empty in the template?
X. All of this logic belongs in commands, not in periodic functions. Periodic functions need to include Scheduler.getInstance().run(); You either use command-based or iterative-based. If you write things inside periodic functions, you don't use command-based. If you do use command-based, you don't write things in periodic functions. Do the switch; whichever is quicker for you and works. Time is short, you need to rewrite and run and make sure it works - tick tock...
4. This, is not how commands work, at all. You just INIT THE COMMAND OBJECT here - writing new Command() doesn't mean it runs right now.
5. MEANINGFUL! NAMES!
6. If you'll need my help with this one, I personally won't be able to help, I don't know these built-in drive control classes.
7. No shortening words in class names, field names, and method names
8. RobotMap doesn't have objects. All of its members are static. You never need a variable type RobotMap.
9. method names are camelCase
10. Same as 8
11. No explicit numbers in code. Use SmartDashboard.
12. You're not using this.
13. You need this line.
14.  This goes in the constructor.
